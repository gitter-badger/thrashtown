# Thrashtown
A simple surf session journal

## Local Development
This is the yeoman generator that was used to scaffold the app:
https://github.com/DaftMonk/generator-angular-fullstack/blob/master/readme.md

Ensure you have these installed on your machine first:
  - mongoDB - database
  - node.js - server
  - yeoman - for various useful generators install with `npm install -g yo`

1. Clone the project
2. From terminal, run `mongod` to start mongoDB
3. From the project root, run `grunt serve` - this should launch the app in a new Chrome tab
